linear types, monomorphized first class streams, fully functional, as fast as C, as ergonomic as python (I kinda want to make it slower than C tho... int should be arbirarily sized by default and kinda of want to do strs as non-linear value types)

oh also monomorphized existential typing...

look at the lisp module for some basic use cases

if you clone this thing... lua is pretty good for syntax highliting
