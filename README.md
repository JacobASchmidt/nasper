linear types, monomorphized first class streams, fully functional, as fast as C, as ergonomic as python (I kinda want to make it slower than C tho... int should be arbirarily sized by default and kinda of want to do strs as value types)

oh also monomorphized existential typing...

look at the lisp module for some basic use cases
