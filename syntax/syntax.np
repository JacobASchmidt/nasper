# list is [A];

# A?? is maybe[A] is union{some a, none ()}
# &A is a borrowed type to A, it means that the value will not be linearly consumed. There are rust like semantics for this
# 'A is a boxed (heap allocated) A, linearly typed
# *A is a frozen A, like an atomic shared ptr to a const val
# .A declares a new type parameter in a function, and is not a type modifier itself, look below in the defs for further explanation
# classes
# () => (); (int, string) => float; &(int, string) => ; etc; |A|; &|A|;

#the reference thing
# just means cant be linearly consumed: &A means you can only do operations that arent linearly consumed

#impl notes...
# rn i really want int to be arbitratily sized (i get the tradeoffs, we would make a lot of number operations generic and allow for int8... etc)
# i also like the idea of all strs being frozen, and just having [byte] and [rune] for mutable stuff... but ultimatly most ppl should just use format and strings.Builder
